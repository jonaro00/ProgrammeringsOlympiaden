# ProgrammeringsOlympiaden

In late 2018, I participated in the school qualifiers for the swedish high school programming competition [Programmeringsolympiaden](https://www.progolymp.se/).
My results were not impressive, but the challenges were really fun and entertaining.
Many months later, I returned to the challenges to improve my programming skills.

This repository is the result of me attempting to solve the challenges with as few lines of Python code as possible, while still keeping it somewhat readable.
If there is no file for a specific challenge, I have not yet come up with a solid solution.
